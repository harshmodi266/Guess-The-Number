# Guess-The-Number
Number Guessing Game





Overview

The Number Guessing Game is an interactive game where players attempt to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This project includes two implementations:





Python Script (guessthenumber.py): A command-line version built with Python, ideal for learning basic programming concepts.



Web Version (index1.html): A browser-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a user-friendly interface with visual feedback.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills, including random number generation, user input handling, and conditional logic, while showcasing web development capabilities with a responsive design.

Features





Dual Implementations:





Python script for terminal-based gameplay.



Web version with a clean, responsive UI.



Interactive Gameplay: Players guess a number and receive feedback (too high, too low, or correct).



Quit Option: Enter "Q" to exit the game at any time.



Responsive Design (Web Version): Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.



Styled Feedback (Web Version): Includes a prominent "Game Over" message with custom styling.



Enter Key Support (Web Version): Press Enter to submit guesses for better usability.

Technologies Used





Python Script:





Python: For game logic and random number generation.



Web Version:





HTML: For the game structure and layout.



CSS: For styling, with a tomato color theme (#ff6347).



JavaScript: For game logic, random number generation, and user input handling.

Prerequisites





Python Script:





Python 3.x installed on your system.



Web Version:





A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Installation

Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/number-guessing-game.git
cd number-guessing-game

Python Script (guessthenumber.py)

No additional setup is required beyond having Python installed.

Web Version (index1.html)

No server setup is required as the game runs entirely in the browser.

Usage

Python Script





Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.



Run the Python script:

python guessthenumber.py



Follow the prompt to guess a number between 1 and 100, or type "Q" to quit.



Receive feedback:





"Your number is too small!" if the guess is too low.



"Your number is too big!" if the guess is too high.



"Success: Correct Guess!!" if you guess correctly.



"-------Game Over--------" when the game ends.

Web Version





Open the index1.html file in a web browser.



Enter a number between 1 and 100 in the input field, or type "Q" to quit.



Click "Submit Guess" or press Enter to check your guess.



Feedback will appear below:





"Your number is too small!" if the guess is too low.



"Your number is too big!" if the guess is too high.



"Success: Correct Guess!!" if you guess correctly, followed by "Game Over".



"Game Over" if you quit by entering "Q".

Screenshots





Python Script: Terminal-based gameplay showing user guesses and feedback.



Web Version: A clean interface with a centered input field, feedback area, and styled "Game Over" message.

Future Enhancements





Add a guess counter to track the number of attempts.



Implement a "Restart Game" button for the web version.



Add sound effects for correct guesses and game over (web version).



Introduce a high score system using local storage (web version) or file storage (Python version).
